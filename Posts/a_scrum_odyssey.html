		<p>I had an unexpected and not entirely unpleasant experience in a recent retrospective meeting: all of the engineers on the team moved to stop having daily standup meetings altogether. Although I'm no stranger to working without standup meetings, and in many ways I prefer that way of working, I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that the majority of engineers are fine with well-structured daily standups.</p>
<p>Even with a team that enjoys standup meetings however, there's value in breaking the norm, becoming more flexible, and trying things out. Maybe such a team would settle back into daily standups, maybe they'd find something else that works for them. Teams which don't enjoy their standups though will almost certaily settle on a new scheme.</p>
<p>I sat down to type out a guide on how and why a team might experiment with alternative approaches to the daily standup. But that came out so incredibly dry I weaved those points into a story demonstrating a hypothetical team undergoing that process. That resulted in something which I'm not entirely sure got the point across. But then I remembered that ChatGPT (insert eye roll here) is actually pretty good at generating Shakespearean sonnets (insert double eye roll here). So, I ran my story through the ringer and I present to you <strong>A Scrum Odyssey: A journey away from daily scrum meetings, as a cycle of eight Shakespearean sonnets</strong>:</p>
<h1>The Rite of Dawn's Assembly</h1>
<p>In days of yore, where standups held their sway,<br />
Religious teams to this rite did cling tight.<br />
Believing in its might, they'd all display<br />
Their tasks and toils, at morning's first light.</p>
<p>“'Tis the only path!” they’d loudly decree,<br />
To boost our voice and our work's potency.<br />
Yet, in this sea of daily scrutiny,<br />
Did they e'er question its necessity?</p>
<p>For in their hearts, joy and productivity,<br />
Seemed hand in hand with scrum's consistency.<br />
But having not trod another pathway,<br />
How sure were they, in their daily ballet?</p>
<p>To question not is to be but a drone,<br />
Yet change may show more ways than they've known.</p>
<h1>Whispers 'Midst the Court of Teams</h1>
<p>As time doth pass, objections loud do cry,<br />
Standups draw long, and patience wears so thin.<br />
Some feel the gaze of oversight too nigh,<br />
Whilst others sigh at tales they're lost within.</p>
<p>The daily rite, once held in high esteem,<br />
Now burdens hearts, and feels not quite so lean.<br />
&quot;Maintain the stand!&quot; the managers exclaim,<br />
&quot;For knowledge's spread, 'tis the only regime.&quot;</p>
<p>Another quips, &quot;'Tis how we stay aligned!&quot;<br />
Yet in their hearts, a restlessness they find.<br />
The status quo, now feels a heavy chain,<br />
With every voice, there grows a silent pain.</p>
<p>Unease doth spread, as waters dark and deep,<br />
The team in hope, for change they might yet reap.</p>
<h1>Into Uncharted Councils Steered</h1>
<p>In growing dissent, the teams make their stand,<br />
To question the rites of daily discourse.<br />
With keen eyes they search, across the vast land,<br />
For new methods, their spirit to endorse.</p>
<p>The captains do doubt, and their concerns voice,<br />
Yet vibrant ideas do from teams arise.<br />
&quot;Demos!&quot; cries one, &quot;Let our works make their noise!&quot;,<br />
Another suggests, one-on-one 'neath the skies.</p>
<p>Pair programming, reviews, new tactics bloom,<br />
As weary traditions begin to wane.<br />
The tides of change, they sweep away the gloom,<br />
Old ways dissolve, as new paths become plain.</p>
<p>Thus in the dance of time and adaptability,<br />
Teams find their stride, and new possibility.</p>
<h1>Quests in the Halls of Converse</h1>
<p>In search of ways, the teams diverge their path,<br />
Asynchronous rites, emails that they pen,<br />
Fewer meets they seek, to avoid the wrath,<br />
Of daily drudgery, again and again.</p>
<p>More intimate chats, one-on-one they hold,<br />
In pair programming, they sharpen their skill.<br />
Exploring each method, both new and old,<br />
They weigh every boon, every bitter pill.</p>
<p>Managers, once stern, now their gaze doth shift,<br />
Witnessing changes, benefits unfold.<br />
Yielding their ground, as sands of time do sift,<br />
Embracing the new, releasing the old.</p>
<p>In the grand ballet of work's ebb and flow,<br />
Teams evolve, and brighter futures they sow.</p>
<h1>Where Two Worlds in Concert Meet</h1>
<p>From all the trials, some choices do emerge,<br />
Asynchronous standups, the globe's teams cheer.<br />
For visual minds, digital boards surge,<br />
As preferred tools, their thoughts to make clear.</p>
<p>Meetings grow few, much to all's delight,<br />
Those that remain, are purposeful and keen.<br />
Gone are the days of endless oversight,<br />
In place, moments of value are seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Support!&quot; cry the captains, in newfound glee,<br />
Feeling the strength of their teams' tethered core.<br />
From the throes of old, they now are set free,<br />
Bonded and strong, as never before.</p>
<p>From trials and tests, the best paths are clear,<br />
Teams and their leaders, in harmony steer.</p>
<h1>Musing on Fortune's Fickle Hand</h1>
<p>With shifts in tide, come trials unforeseen,<br />
Some souls do long for morning meetings past.<br />
An anchor lost, in routines once serene,<br />
Others claim that commitment's not so vast.</p>
<p>Managers note, their gaze oft on boards dwell,<br />
More than before, in this changed paradigm.<br />
For in each change, some benefits dispel,<br />
Replaced by costs, in this evolving time.</p>
<p>&quot;No method’s perfect,&quot; the team concedes true,<br />
Every path has its toll, its weight to bear.<br />
But in pursuit of what’s best, they pursue,<br />
Balancing gains, with costs they must wear.</p>
<p>In life’s grand dance of loss and of gain,<br />
Teams learn to thrive, through pleasure and pain.</p>
<h1>Melding Yesteryears with the Morrow</h1>
<p>From experiments vast, wisdom teams glean,<br />
Blending the best from methods they've tried.<br />
A hybrid emerges, both fresh and seen,<br />
Balancing old and new, side by side.</p>
<p>Asynchronous notes, for days in-between,<br />
With face-to-face meets, weekly they decide.<br />
Though returning to paths once before seen,<br />
They come renewed, with broader stride.</p>
<p>Most vital of all, in this new phase,<br />
Teams claim their process, its reins they hold.<br />
Each member engaged, in collective praise,<br />
For a system by them, shaped and molded.</p>
<p>From trials diverse, a way they have found,<br />
Where every voice in harmony does sound.</p>
<h1>Ascendance Beyond Time's Norms</h1>
<p>In newfound grace, the teams now flex and bend,<br />
Having learnt the worth of norms held askew.<br />
Witnessed have they, to what change can tend,<br />
The boon of steps, both retraced and anew.</p>
<p>The culture's hue, to feedback does incline,<br />
Embracing shifts, with open arms and heart.<br />
Where once was rigidity, now they entwine<br />
Flexibility, as their foremost art.</p>
<p>Managers see, that control's grip too tight,<br />
Does not always lead to the best of ways.<br />
Productivity, in this newfound light,<br />
Reaches peaks unseen, to everyone's praise.</p>
<p>From challenging norms, to heights unforeseen,<br />
They've journeyed forth, with purpose evergreen.</p>
