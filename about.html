	<p>I am a software engineer, architect, and team leader based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, though I have always worked distributed. As such, I have had the pleasure of working with firms all across the US.</p>
<p>Currently I'm working for Crate &amp; Barrel developing new ecommerce solutions, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cloud-based systems. In my career I have worked as an independent consultant (as well as holding a couple of employed positions) spread across several industries, while technologically I have largely focussed on Microsoft and .NET technologies. That has led me to engage with a multitude of problems, with which I have gained particular experience related to distributed and concurrent systems, web applications and services, cloud and infrastructure management, and cross-platform and mobile applications.</p>
<p>In spite of my being an old curmudgeon at heart, the more time I spend in software development, the clearer it becomes that there is no single, absolute Theory of Everything to succinctly describe how to develop software. No two firms, no two systems, no two teams, and indeed no two problems are ever exactly alike, and each requires a solution tailored for it. To that end, software development is as much an art as it is a science, and it requires that those of us engaged in it employ our pathos as much as our logos to do it well. This is a discipline that requires constant reevaluation, constant learning, and full-contact engagement. That is my guiding light in how I approach my work: nothing is certain, embrace the chaos!</p>
<p>I am typically preaching that sermon in my own head, engaged with the problems that torment me so. However, I do occasionally make an effort to engage with the world. I enjoy maintaining a small number of open-source projects on GitHub, speaking at and attending conferences around the Midwest, and sharing what I can on this site - technical knowledge, lessons learned, and experiences gained. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, canoeing, playing the saxophone, and talking with folks at my local pub (where I am a founding member of the mug club, no less). Before all this, I studied Philosophy and Computer Science at the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>If you're reading this, I hope in some way I've been able to be helpful for you. I look forward to hearing from you, or perhaps seeing you at a conference - don't hesitate to reach out and say hi!</p>
