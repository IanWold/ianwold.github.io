	<p>I am a software engineer, architect, and team leader based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, though I have always worked distributed. As such, I have had the pleasure of working with firms all across the US. My alma mater is the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where I studied Philosophy and Computer Science.</p>
<p>Currently I'm working for Crate &amp; Barrel developing new ecommerce solutions, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cloud-based systems. In my career I have worked as an independent consultant (as well as holding a couple of employed positions) spread across several industries, while technologically I have largely focussed on Microsoft and .NET technologies. That has led me to engage with a multitude of problems, with which I have gained particular experience related to distributed and concurrent systems, web applications and services, cloud and infrastructure management, and cross-platform and mobile applications.</p>
<p>In the past I wrote a few articles for my site, though presently I'm trying to make a greater effort to share some of my observations and knowledge here. I do casually maintain a couple of projects on GitHub, and I try to be present at conferences throughout the midwest. If you're reading this, I hope in some way I've been able to be helpful for you. I look forward to hearing from you, or perhaps seeing you at a conference - don't hesitate to reach out and say hi!</p>
