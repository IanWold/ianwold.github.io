# GitHub Projects

## Language/Parsing

[**SpracheJSON**](https://github.com/IanWold/SpracheJSON) is also on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpracheJSON)

SpracheJSON is a JSON parser/mapper/serializer written with Sprache for C#. Easy to use, and fully-functional (I think).

[**SpracheDown**](https://github.com/IanWold/SpracheDown)

SpracheDown is a MarkDown parser written in Sprache for C#. A while ago at the Iowa Code Camp, someone asked if it was possible to make a MarkDown parser in Sprache, so this is to show it can be done.

[**Hacky Lambdas**](https://github.com/IanWold/HackyLambdas)

For my final project for my Lambda Calculus course, I designed a very hacky typed LC interpreter! Wooo.

## Console Gaming

[**Outrage Engine**](https://github.com/IanWold/OutrageEngine)

A game engine for ASCII games in the Windows Console, because that's the best platform for cutting edge game development.

[**Console2048**](https://github.com/IanWold/Console2048)

This is a version of the popular 2048 game in the Windows console, because no other platform provides such clarity and authenticity for such a game.

[**ConsoleMinesweeper**](https://github.com/IanWold/ConsoleMinesweeper)

Minesweeper in the Windows console. See *Console2048*.

## Miscellaneous

[**Metalsharp**](https://github.com/ianwold/Metalsharp)

A tiny and extendable C# library for generating static sites, inspired by the [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/) library for JavsScript.

[**Monokai Gray**](https://github.com/IanWold/MonokaiGray) is also on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Monokai%20Gray)

A Sublime Text 3 color scheme, the same as Monokai dark, but has true gray backgrounds. Useful with themes where the yellowey background of Monokai feels out of place. Pending interest, a Visual Studio version may be forthcoming...

[**Rusty Calculator**](https://github.com/IanWold/RustyCalculator)

Rusty Calculator is a small desktop calculator (for Windows) that can sit nicely on your taskbar and be called when needed. It's very nice.
