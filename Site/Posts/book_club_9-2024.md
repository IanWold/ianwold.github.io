As I [posted a couple weeks ago](https://ian.wold.guru/Posts/why_i_have_this_blog.html), this month is the anniversary of restarting my blog! As though trapped in a Norm MacDonald interview, I'm frequently asked by my colleagues where I get my ideas from. Thus, for today's book club I'm just going to share a list of blogs which I tune into frequently. Some of them are folks I've bumped into at a conference, others are folks who just came across my radar at some point. Some blogs haven't gotten an update in a bit, some are quite active. All of them are somehow related to software engineering.
