**Less is More** Write less code, use fewer abstractions, be simple and concise. Complexity is easy, simplicity is hard.

**Diff Your Commits** Read your own code before you commit it, before you PR it, and after you merge it. Keep your code tidy and clear.

**Document Why, not How** I can (usually) figure out how to use your code. I can (usually) never figure out why you wrote it that way.

**Collaborating over Coding** Software Engineering is 9 parts collaboration and 1 part coding. Be approachable and helpful, reach out to others often.

**Respect Legacy Code** There is much wisdom in legacy code. Understand before judging, embrace before extinguishing.

**Continuous Learning/Continuous Improvement** Always learn, always try new things, always be open-minded.

**Embrace Change** Change is the only constant. Expect it, embrace it, and code for it.

**Lift Everyone Up** Share knowledge openly, celebrate accomplishments, support and mentor freely. You grow the most when you help others grow.
