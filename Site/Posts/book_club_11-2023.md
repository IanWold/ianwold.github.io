_My Book Club is a monthly curated list of things I've been reading or watching, sent out via my newsletter. If you'd like to follow along with me, please [subscribe to my newsletter](https://buttondown.email/ianwold)._

I'm looking forward to turkey day next week gobble gobble! This year I'm thankful that I work in ecommerce so I get to have a peaceful extended weekend because nobody visits ecommerce sites on Thanksgiving weekend.

At least that's what they told me in the interview before they hired me.

Anyway, I've been taking in a lot of ideas about agile, development process, and the SDLC, and I think I now have a mathematical proof that every day is opposite day. Everything that seems determinable about software process seems to directly contradict common sense and reason.

Take the #NoEstimates crowd - they say estimates are always wrong so they should _never_ be done. Never? Like ever? How do I know when I'm going to deliver a project? Turns out that after just three sprints, you can pretty accurately project when a project is going to finish by counting the number of cards that enter the backlog on average vs. the number of cards that get completed on average. Yes - _just counting cards_ is always more reliable than trying to do estimates. Who'da thunk?

I think the starting point here is that most everyone I know tends to be completely fed up with Scrum. A lot of people I talk to will go so far as to say they hate "Agile". But wait a minute there, because these aren't the same concept. I think I agree with Allen Holub on this point: Real Agile good, fake Agile (_ahem_ Scrum) bad.

Even if you actually don't prefer Agile - there's aspects of the Agile commandments that I question - I think these resources are a great dive into the possibilities.
