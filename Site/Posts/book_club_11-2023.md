_My Book Club is a monthly curated list of things I've been reading or watching, sent out via my newsletter. If you'd like to follow along with me, please [subscribe to my newsletter](https://buttondown.email/ianwold)._

I'm looking forward to turkey day next week gobble gobble! This year I'm thankful that I work in ecommerce so I get to have a peaceful extended weekend because nobody visits ecommerce sites on Thanksgiving weekend. At least that's what they told me in the interview before they hired me.

Anyway, I've been taking in a lot of ideas about agile, development process, and the SDLC, and I think I now have a mathematical proof that every day is opposite day: everything that seems determinable about software process seems to directly contradict common sense and reason. The best way to manage a team is for the team to manage themselves, the best way to deliver estimates is to never deliver estimates, Scrum is the opposite of Agile, and so on.

The question of how to structure the software engineering process is, I think it can be said noncontroversially, going to be answered very differently by different teams. This is why I have been and remain dedicated to Agile (as a set of _principles_, not _dogma_) as the basis for these processes. Deliver value early and often, change the actual process itself as the team and product evolve, and eliminate any blockers to being able to do those two.

What I've taken away from my readings this month are two new tools I'm going to add to my belt: #NoEstimates and "hypothesis over requirements", two concepts explained in the Allen Holub videos I share. Individually, either might be fine, but I think the real value of these are when used together. I doubt that these practices could just be adopted willy nilly by a regular scrum team tomorrow - these describe a way for business to work, as much as they describe a way for engineering teams to work. If all the stakeholders can be aligned on this though, and if the constraints on the project allow it, there's a potential for a huge benefit here.

But what is there for those of us stuck in regular Scrum teams that might not be able to adopt these right away, or ever? I've become very interested in this question, and I think I've found a few practices that could meaningfully help any engineering team. I'm certainly going to be bringing these practices up at my day job, and in future I may write on their success.
