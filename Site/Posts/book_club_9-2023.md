_Author's Note: this first "Book Club" post is not included in the newsletter; I hadn't yet set up the newsletter._

Last week I attended the final [Strange Loop Conference](https://thestrangeloop.com/). This conference has been very influential on my career and my academic interests. In fact, this conference began a short time before I started making money in software. Having been able to watch the talks on the YouTubes over the years, I credit it with having a significant impact on how I've approached my career as well as my studies in college, where I got bachelors' in both philosophy and computer science.

However, I had never been to a Strange Loop before! It's bitersweet then that I was able to attend the final one. Perhaps unurprisingly, I attended several presentations sponsored by (or should I say "presented by"? unsure) [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/). In that spirit, I'm going to share five papers here that cut across my philosophical and computer science inclinations that I have very much enjoyed over the years:

* [Generalized Parser Combinators - Daniel Spiewak](https://dinhe.net/~aredridel/.notmine/PDFs/Parsing/SPIEWAK%2C%20Daniel%20%282010%29%20-%20Generalized%20Parser%20Combinators.pdf)
* [Semantic Information and the Correctness Theory of Truth - Luciano Floridi](https://philpapers.org/archive/FLOSIA-5.pdf)
* [Idris, a General Purpose Dependently Typed Programming Language: Design and Implementation - Edwin Brady](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/papers/impldtp.pdf)
* [Russell's 1903-1905 Anticiaption of the Lambda Calculus - Kevin C. Klement](https://people.umass.edu/klement/lambda.pdf)
* [Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures - Roy Thomas Fielding](https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)
