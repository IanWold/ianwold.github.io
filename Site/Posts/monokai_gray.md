About a week (?) or so ago I hashed out a quick Sublime Text color scheme called Monokai Gray. I did so because I desperately love Monokai and I love the [Wombat Theme](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Wombat%20Theme) as well. Unfortunately, I couldn't use Monokai with Wombat (without throwing up) because the yellowey hue of Monokai clashed with the classy grays of Wombat. Truthfully, I had been using a similar color scheme in Visual Studio for some time (the yellowey background didn't fly there, either). So I copied many of the colors over and prettied it up a tad, and this was the result.

Here's a preview of what it looks like with some code I got [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms) using the aforementioned Wombat Theme:

If you think it's neat, you can [check it out](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Monokai%20Gray) on Package Control. I love feedback and pull requests alike!
