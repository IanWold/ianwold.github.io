If you've visited my blog before, you know that I live in Minneapolis. I state that on my about page, my now page, my GitHub profile, and in plenty of articles I've written on this blog. I've always loved this city, and I love living here.

Unless you've been living under a rock for the last month, you've seen that my city is in an interesting way right now. Several colleagues have reached out to me in the last month to check in on me. That's been very much appreciated. I am alright, considering.

There's a lot of folks in the Twin Cities that aren't alright though. In case anyone reads my blog from afar and feels a need to help out in any way, I want to encourage you to visit [standwithminnesota.com](https://www.standwithminnesota.com/). There are plenty of ways to help, financially and otherwise.

I make a point of (largely) avoiding political conversation on my professional software engineering blog. I will stress that we must not consider discussion about ICE's activity in Minneapolis to be "political;" the totality of what the federal government has fashioned here is another thing entirely.

Thanks again to all my colleagues for your care and support!
