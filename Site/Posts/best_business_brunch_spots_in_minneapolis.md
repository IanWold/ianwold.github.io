I've been working as a software engineer in the Twin Cities for quite some time, and I value keeping up with my colleagues here. The best way to meet up with folks is a well-timed Business Brunch™, and Minneapolis offers many great options for a successful business brunch. What I look for in a place is fast service, food that's good and familiar, an atmosphere that allows conversation, and well-priced mimosas (most importantly). Over the last year and a half I've been branching out and trying many places for business brunches, and I'm happy to share this list of the best spots _so far_! If you're in Minneapolis you probably already know many of these spots, and I can recommend them for a business brunch. If you find yourself visiting and need to meet a colleague, then look no further:
