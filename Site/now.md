At this _very instant_ I am...

**Living** in Minneapolis, where I enjoy walking, biking, or canoeing to get to where I want to be. I attend events around the Twin Cities and I'm frequently at various local bars and breweries catching up with my neighbors and friends! I'm still sad that the [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/) has ended.

**Working** for [Crate & Barrel](https://www.crateandbarrel.com) on modernizing (read: distributing) their ecommerce system, where I get to work with a bunch of fantastic people!

**Updating** all my things to the new .NET version.

**Developing** more apps like my [FreePlanningPoker.io](https://ian.wold.guru/Posts/free_planning_poker.html). A lot of simple apps require login credentials or expose your data to someone's server or run inefficiently or aren't open source or easily independently deployable. That's a lot of ors and I wish more of the tools I rely on were like this, so I'm making more.

**Practicing** my skills in pool and billiards. [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker) is my favorite sport, and while I don't have easy access to a table in Minneapolis, I can practice other cue sports. Fun fact: work colleagues and I invented [Full-Rack Pool](http://fullrackpool.com/)!
