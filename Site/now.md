_This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)._

**Living** in Minnapolis, where I enjoy walking, biking, or canoeing to get to where I want to be. I attend events around the Twin Cities and I'm frequently at various local bars and breweries catching up with my neighbors and friends! I'm sad that the [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/) has ended.

**Working** for [Crate & Barrel](https://www.crateandbarrel.com) on modernizing (read: distributing) their ecommerce system, and I get to work with a bunch of fantastic people!

**Having fun** [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)-ify my website. Creating this "now" page is related to that.

**Researching/Considering** distributed systems architectures. Distributed systems are hard.

**Developing** my skills in pool and billiards. [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker) is my favorite sport, and while I don't have easy access to a table in Minneapolis, I can practice other cue sports.

**Added** this "now" page. Wondering what else I could put here and how I might keep it up-to-date.
