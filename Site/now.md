At this _very instant_ I am...

**Living** in Minneapolis, where I enjoy walking, biking, or canoeing to get to where I want to be. I attend events around the Twin Cities and I'm frequently at various local bars and breweries catching up with my neighbors and friends! I'm still sad that the [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/) has ended.

**Working** for [Crate & Barrel](https://www.crateandbarrel.com) on modernizing (read: distributing) their ecommerce system, where I get to work with a bunch of fantastic people!

**Updating** all my things to the new .NET version.

**Developing** [PostgreSignalR](https://github.com/IanWold/PostgreSignalR), a PostgreSQL backplane for SignalR.

**Searching** for more [business brunch](https://ian.wold.guru/Posts/best_business_brunch_spots_in_minneapolis.html) restaurants in Minneapolis.

_This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). You can see its [update history on GitHub](https://github.com/IanWold/ianwold.github.io/commits/master/Site/now.md)._
