At this _very instant_ I am...

**Living** in Minneapolis, where I enjoy walking, biking, or canoeing to get to where I want to be. I attend events around the Twin Cities and I'm frequently at various local bars and breweries catching up with my neighbors and friends! I'm still sad that the [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/) has ended.

**Working** for [Crate & Barrel](https://www.crateandbarrel.com) on modernizing (read: distributing) their ecommerce system, where I get to work with a bunch of fantastic people!

**Researching** distributed systems architectures. Distributed systems are hard.

**Collecting** evidence against [ORMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping). I had been brushing up on classic design patterns for this month's book club, but that sent me down an ORM rabbit hole, so I'm focusing on that instead. I'm not a fan of ORMs, particularly in the case of .NET where a simple wrapper around ADO produces faster code that's easier to maintain and conforms better to a system's requriements. What about other languages? Are ORMs universally bad? Are they good in cases other than rapid prototyping? If you've got any thoughts on this, you should [contact me](https://ian.wold.guru/connect.html), and if you want to see what I come up with then you should [subscribe to my book club](https://buttondown.email/ianwold)!

**Practicing** my skills in pool and billiards. [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker) is my favorite sport, and while I don't have easy access to a table in Minneapolis, I can practice other cue sports.

**Developing** [freeplanningpoker.io](https://freeplanningpoker.io) because every other online tool for this is costly or limited or not what I want, and this is an easy sort of thing to do. Want to help? I have some [good first issues](https://github.com/IanWold/PlanningPoker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) defined in the repository!

**Wondering** what else I could include on this page and how I might keep it up-to-date.
