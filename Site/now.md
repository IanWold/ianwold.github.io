At this _very instant_ I am...

**Living** in Minneapolis, where I enjoy walking, biking, or canoeing to get to where I want to be. I attend events around the Twin Cities and I'm frequently at various local bars and breweries catching up with my neighbors and friends! I'm still sad that the [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/) has ended.

**Working** for [Crate & Barrel](https://www.crateandbarrel.com) on modernizing (read: distributing) their ecommerce system, where I get to work with a bunch of fantastic people!

**Researching** distributed systems architectures. Distributed systems are hard.

**Reconsiering** some of the classic design principles - SOLID, ACID, and the like. Are they still relevant (answer: probably) and in what ways? How has our perception and use of them changed over time? This was going to be my book club topic last month, but I got distracted by ORMs. If you've got any thoughts on this, you should [contact me](https://ian.wold.guru/connect.html), and if you want to see what I come up with then you should [subscribe to my book club](https://buttondown.email/ianwold)!

**Practicing** my skills in pool and billiards. [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker) is my favorite sport, and while I don't have easy access to a table in Minneapolis, I can practice other cue sports.

**Wondering** what else I could include on this page and how I might keep it up-to-date.
