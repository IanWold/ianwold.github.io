At this _very instant_ I am...

**Living** in Minneapolis, where I enjoy walking, biking, or canoeing to get to where I want to be. I attend events around the Twin Cities and I'm frequently at various local bars and breweries catching up with my neighbors and friends! I'm still sad that the [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/) has ended.

**Working** for [Crate & Barrel](https://www.crateandbarrel.com) on modernizing (read: distributing) their ecommerce system, where I get to work with a bunch of fantastic people!

**Enjoying** the last few weeks of summer. Minneapolis has great summers but less than great winters!

**Practicing** my skills in pool and billiards. [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker) is my favorite sport, and while I don't have easy access to a table in Minneapolis, I can practice other cue sports.
