At this _very instant_ I am...

**Living** in Minneapolis, where I enjoy walking, biking, or canoeing to get to where I want to be. I attend events around the Twin Cities and I'm frequently at various local bars and breweries catching up with my neighbors and friends! I'm still sad that the [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/) has ended.

**Working** for [Crate & Barrel](https://www.crateandbarrel.com) on modernizing (read: distributing) their ecommerce system, where I get to work with a bunch of fantastic people!

**Tinkering** with Postgres _a lot_. I'm finding a particular interest in refactors involving it, but also experimenting developing a SignalR backplane for it. We'll see where we end up.

**Developing** More apps like my [FreePlanningPoker.io](https://ian.wold.guru/Posts/free_planning_poker.html). A lot of simple apps require login credentials or expose your data to someone's server or run inefficiently or aren't open source or easily independently deployable. That's a lot of ors and I wish more of the tools I rely on were like this, so I'm making more.

**Practicing** my skills in pool and billiards. [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker) is my favorite sport, and while I don't have easy access to a table in Minneapolis, I can practice other cue sports.

**Getting lost** in corn mazes and feeding goats at nearby farms. This staves off the dread of the impending winter! Why do we call them "corn mazes" and not "maize mazes"?

**Finishing** my [Fallacies of Distributed Computing series](https://ian.wold.guru/Series/fallacies_distributed_computing.html). The last one is almost done!
