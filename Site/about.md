I am a software engineer, architect, and team leader based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, though I have always worked distributed. As such, I have had the pleasure of working with firms all across the US. My alma mater is the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where I studied Philosophy and Computer Science.

Currently I'm working for Crate & Barrel developing new ecommerce solutions, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cloud-based systems. In my career I have worked as an independent consultant (as well as holding a couple of employed positions) spread across several industries and engaged with a multitude of problems. I've primarily worked in the Microsoft stack, though I have worked in - and have a great interest in - most any technologies with which you can build software.
