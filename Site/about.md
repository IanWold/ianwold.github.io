Hi, I'm Ian! I'm a software engineer, architect, and team leader based in Minneapolis with 14 years of professional experience. My bread and butter is .NET, but I find enjoyment and interest in using a diverse set of technologies. My alma mater is the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where I studied Philosophy and Computer Science.

I spend the majority of my time solving the same problems over and over again, breaking them down and looking at them from different angles. I enjoy finding simple, elegant solutions to complicated problems. I think the best solutions come from thoughtful and deliberate relationships with _people_ - people using, commissioning, or otherwise affected by my code. Ideally, I'd like those solutions to last for a while.

Outside of work, I find balance in my hobbies and my community. I'm frequently posted up at local pubs and breweries - interrupted by the occasional church gathering - speaking with my neighbors and meeting new folks. I keep my body active by walking, biking, or canoeing, and I keep my eye sharp with my enjoyment of billiards. My passion for philosophy adds a lot of color to my life, and my amateur engagement with classical architecture reminds me of the importance of crafting enduring, beautiful work.

# Connect

You should reach out. No, really! I'm always open to have a conversation or read your comments.

**Say Hi!**

**Stay Updated**

To keep up-to-date with me, I'd encourage you to [subscribe to my book club](https://buttondown.email/ianwold) where I share what I'm reading and what I've written. Otherwise, my [RSS feed](https://ian.wold.guru/feed.xml) has just my posts here.

This site is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IanWold/ianwold.github.io) - you can watch the repo or [follow me](https://github.com/IanWold) to stay up-to-date.

**Support my Work**

Finally, if you might want to help me out with server costs and the like (and put a big smile on my face) you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/ianwold)! I promise to spend it on servers and not coffee.

# Projects

I maintain or help maintain, somewhat sporadically, the following:

**Metalsharp** on [GitHub](https://github.com/IanWold/Metalsharp) and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalsharp/): A tiny and extendable C# library for generating static sites, inspired by Metalsmith.

**Sprache** on [GitHub](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache)- and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalsharp/): Sprache is a simple, lightweight library for constructing parsers directly in C# code.

**Monokai Gray** on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Monokai%20Gray) and [GitHub](https://github.com/IanWold/MonokaiGray): A Sublime Text 3 color scheme, the same as Monokai dark, but has “true” gray backgrounds. Useful with themes where the yellowey background of Monokai feels out of place.
