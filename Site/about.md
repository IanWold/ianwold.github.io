I am a software and web developer currently employed by [Dalex Livestock Solutions](http://www.dalex.com) where I employ my .NET knowledge with WPF, ASP.NET, and Xamarin. In my free time, I work on various side projects (which I have on [GitHub](https://github.com/ianwold)), give short talks here and there, and occasionally do a blog on this site. Before all this, I received degrees in Philosophy and Computer Science from the University of Iowa.

I enjoy working with Microsoft technologies (because they work), but in addition to that I enjoy all sorts of UX/UI work, as well as programming languages.

Feel free to contact or connect with me for anything. I'll respond as promptly as I'm able.
