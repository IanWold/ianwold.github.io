I am a software engineer, architect, and team leader based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've always worked distributed though, so I've have had the pleasure of working with firms all across the US. My alma mater is the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where I studied Philosophy and Computer Science.

I spent the first many years of my career as an independent consultant, though the last couple of positions I've held have been salaried. I've primarily worked in the Microsoft stack, though I have worked in - and have a great interest in - most any technologies with which you can build software. Currently I'm working for Crate & Barrel developing new ecommerce solutions, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cloud-based systems.
