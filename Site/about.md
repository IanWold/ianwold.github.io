I am a software engineer, architect, and team leader based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've always worked distributed though, so I've have had the pleasure of working with firms all across the US. My alma mater is the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where I studied Philosophy and Computer Science.

I spent the first many years of my career as an independent consultant, though the last couple of positions I've held have been salaried. I've primarily worked in the Microsoft stack, though I have worked in - and have a great interest in - most any technologies with which you can build software. Currently I'm working for Crate & Barrel developing new ecommerce solutions, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cloud-based systems.

To keep up-to-date with me, I'd encourage you to [subscribe to my newsletter](https://buttondown.email/ianwold) where I share what I'm reading and what I've written. Otherwise, my [RSS feed](https://ian.wold.guru/feed.xml) has just my posts here.

Finally, if you might want to help me out with server costs and the like (and put a big smile on my face) you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/ianwold)! I promise to spend it on servers and not coffee.

# Projects

I maintain or help maintain, somewhat sporadically, the following:

**Metalsharp** on [GitHub](https://github.com/IanWold/Metalsharp) and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalsharp/): A tiny and extendable C# library for generating static sites, inspired by Metalsmith.

**Sprache** on [GitHub]([https://github.com/IanWold/Metalsharp](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache)) and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalsharp/): Sprache is a simple, lightweight library for constructing parsers directly in C# code.

**Monokai Gray** on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Monokai%20Gray) and [GitHub](https://github.com/IanWold/MonokaiGray): A Sublime Text 3 color scheme, the same as Monokai dark, but has “true” gray backgrounds. Useful with themes where the yellowey background of Monokai feels out of place.
