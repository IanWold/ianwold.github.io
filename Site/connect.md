You should reach out. No, really! I'm always open to have a conversation or read your comments.

**Say Hi!**

* Did I say something on this blog that inspired you or caught you off guard?
* Do you have a professional inquiry, or is there something I can help you with?
* Do you just want to connect?

If so, then I want to hear from you! Please email me at [ian@wold.guru](mailto:ian@wold.guru?subject=Hello) to get in touch. I have notifications set up for these emails; you're guaranteed to reach me.

**Webmention**

My site accepts [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) at `https://webmention.io/ian.wold.guru/webmention`. If you link one of my posts, be sure to webmention me! They'll show up at the bottom of my post.

**Stay Updated**

To keep up-to-date with me, I'd encourage you to [subscribe to my book club](https://buttondown.email/ianwold) where I share what I'm reading and what I've written. Otherwise, my [RSS feed](https://ian.wold.guru/feed.xml) has just my posts here.

This site is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IanWold/ianwold.github.io) - you can watch the repo or [follow me](https://github.com/IanWold) to stay up-to-date.

**Support my Work**

Finally, if you might want to help me out with server costs and the like (and put a big smile on my face) you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/ianwold)! I promise to spend it on servers and not coffee.
